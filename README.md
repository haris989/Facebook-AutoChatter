# Facebook-AutoChatter 
This extension chats automatically on your behalf on Facebook. Just open the messages page of your Facebook and find the Autochat button. Enjoy!
This extension uses machine learning technique to train the bot using the data fed. The bot trains itself using more and more data provided with time and chats more intelligently.
Since this extension is not present on Chrome web store you will have to install it manually using the following steps.

Step1 - Go to Chrome Menu > More Tools > Extensions.

Step 2 - Check the Developer mode and click load unpacked extensions.

Step 3 - Download the folder including manifest.json file and show it the path where the extension is downloaded.

Step 4 - The extension is now installed and you should see "AutoChat using AutoChatter" icon present on www.facebook.com/messages/t page.

I don't intend to and will never extract your personal chats/data etc using this extension. Even the training data used to train the bot is created by my own. So you can relax and intall this extension without worrying about privacy issues.
